## The Three-Pillar Frame

The brand operates on three pillars; every editable surface should answer which one it serves.

| Pillar | Surface | Lives in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Experience** — the Saturdays | `/episodes` | `lib/content.ts` (SEAson 1 episodes, itineraries, FAQ) |
| **Product** — the Archive | `/archive` | `lib/archive.ts` (three rings) |
| **Community** — the Crew | `/crew` | `lib/crew.ts` (composition, Bring-a-Crew, Founding Crew) |

Membership tiers (`lib/membership.ts`) describe themselves *across* the three pillars rather than as a flat feature list. The Network (`lib/network.ts`) is the partner-access layer that delivers Product and Experience benefits.

## Editing Content

All copy + data lives in `lib/`. Edit there instead of digging into components.

- `lib/config.ts` — site-wide constants (booking URL, brand line, emails)
- `lib/content.ts` — SEAson 1 Episodes, Itineraries, Episode-page pillars, included rows, FAQ
- `lib/membership.ts` — Crew / Captain / Commodore tiers (each with E×P×C benefits) + Membership FAQ
- `lib/network.ts` — seven verticals + anchor partners + pipeline
- `lib/moments.ts` — Featured Network Moments (FIFA 2026, Art Basel, F1 Miami, BVI, Faena, Coachella)
- `lib/archive.ts` — three product rings (HVRBOR-direct, co-branded, partner)
- `lib/crew.ts` — SEAson 1 composition snapshot, Bring-a-Crew rules, Founding Crew copy
- `lib/log.ts` — publication articles with category + body

Every export is typed — TypeScript flags missing fields when you add new items.

## Forms + API Routes

Three forms post to JSON API routes:

- `/api/apply` — Captain casting standby (`ApplyForm`)
- `/api/newsletter` — The List newsletter signup (`NewsletterSignup`)
- `/api/bottle-episode` — Private full-boat charter inquiry (`BottleEpisodes`)

All three call `lib/notify.ts`, which always logs the submission to the server console and additionally calls Resend if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set. The user-facing flow returns success either way — the form never breaks because of a missing key.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` to configure email delivery.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Enables outbound email via Resend | unset (logs only) |
| `RESEND_FROM` | From address on outbound mail | `notifications@hvrbor.club` |
| `APPLY_INBOX` | Captain apply destination | `hello@hvrbor.club` |
| `BOTTLE_INBOX` | Bottle Episode destination | `hello@hvrbor.club` |
| `NEWSLETTER_INBOX` | Newsletter destination | `hello@hvrbor.club` |

Without `RESEND_API_KEY` the site is fully functional — submissions log to the Vercel function logs (or local console in dev) and return success to the user. Set the key when you're ready to receive real mail.

## Design System

Defined in `tailwind.config.ts`:

### Colors

- `ink` — `#0A0A0A` (primary dark)
- `paper` — `#F5F2EC` (primary light)
- `cyan` — `#00E5FF` (accent)
- `cyan-deep` — `#00BCD4`
- `fog` — `#1A1A1A` (dark card)
- `dust` — `#2A2A28` (darker section bg)
- `line` — `#333333` (dividers on dark)
- `muted` — `#8A8A86` (muted text)

### Fonts (all loaded via `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx`)

- `font-display` — Anton (oversized display)
- `font-sub` — Bebas Neue (secondary display)
- `font-mono` — Share Tech Mono (data / labels / eyebrows)
- `font-sans` — DM Sans (body)

### Shadows

- `shadow-hard` — `8px 8px 0 #0A0A0A`
- `shadow-hard-cyan` — `8px 8px 0 #00E5FF`
- `shadow-hard-xl` / `shadow-hard-xl-cyan` — larger hover state
- `shadow-soft` — `4px 4px 0 #0A0A0A`

### Utilities (in `globals.css`)

- `border-hard` — 3px ink border
- `border-paper` — 3px paper border
- `border-cyan-hard` — 3px cyan border
- `text-outline` — outlined text treatment
- `text-outline-cyan` — cyan outlined text

## Next Steps / TODOs

When you pick this up in Claude Code, the usual first-pass things to tackle:

**Form submission wiring.** `Contact.tsx` currently simulates the submit with a timeout. Options:

1. Formspree or similar — swap the `onSubmit` body for a `fetch` to their endpoint.
2. Resend + a `/app/api/contact/route.ts` handler for a native Next.js API route.
3. Supabase insert if you want a contacts table in the existing Red Sea Lion stack.

**Metadata and OG.** `app/layout.tsx` has baseline metadata — add OG images (`/public/og.jpg`), a favicon, and structured data when the brand assets are finalized.

**Analytics.** Drop in Vercel Analytics, Plausible, or PostHog. Likely a single `<Script>` in `layout.tsx`.

**Deployment.** Ready for Vercel out of the box. `vercel --prod` from root, or push to GitHub and connect.

**Asset layer.** The `/public` folder is empty. Add:

- `favicon.ico`
- `og.jpg` (1200×630 for social)
- Any brand marks or illustrations

### Boilerplate (copy-ready, 49 words)

> HVRBOR.CLUB is a year-round Miami membership built on a flotilla. Eight Saturdays per SEAson on Biscayne Bay, twelve seats per Episode, and a Network of priority access across Entertainment, Sports, Health and Wellness, Hospitality, Travel, Retail, and Nightlife. Sailing from Miami Beach Marina, June 20, 2026. A GHXSTSHIP brand.

### Tagline

> Saturdays are for the sea.

Lowercase "sea", period (not exclamation). Never paraphrase. Always the refrain.

### Brand Voice

Five sources: **Tomorrowland** (ritual + worldbuilding), **Yacht Week** (flotilla earnestness, group euphoria), **American Express** (card-as-status, refined service), **Jungle Cruise** (theatrical destination naming, captain-narrator), **Tony Stark** (dry confidence, declarative cadence, never explains).

Synthesis: **Upscale Adventure × Social Luxury.** Less explainer prose, more declarative. Drop schlubby asides. Let ritual carry weight. *Of course it works. Of course there is a number on the back of your card.*

### Brand Assets

Downloadable assets live in `/public/press/` and are served from the site root.

| File | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hvrbor-club-colors.json` | Canonical color palette (hex + semantic roles) | Locked |
| `hvrbor-club-wordmark.svg` | Primary wordmark, SVG with font-as-paths | **Pending final export from design** |
| `hvrbor-club-wordmark-mono.svg` | Single-color variant (no cyan accent) | Pending |
| `hvrbor-club-lockup@2x.png` | Raster fallback, 2x density | Pending |

When the design team exports the final wordmark, drop the SVG into `/public/press/` with the filename above. The table updates itself — no other code changes needed.
